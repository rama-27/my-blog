# Two Sum problem

### description: 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that the sum of the two numbers add up to a given **"k"(target)** value.

Example:
Given nums = [1,6,9,3,2,5]  and k=8

here nums[1]+nums[4]=6+2=8 therefore return [1,4]


Approach:
you can solve the problem in two ways:
1. Brute Force
2. using Hash Map / Hash Table

#### Brute Force
- Using Brute Force we'll try every possible combination to find and return the indices
The time complexity is O(n*n)

#### Hash Map
- Using Hash Map, We will insert every element of the array into list one by one.

- If we find the target - value in the hashmap then we will return the hash[target-value] and  current "i".<br/><br/>
*note** where i is the current pointing index in the array during the iteration
